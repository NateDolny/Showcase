            m-5">As a third-year computer science student at the University of 
            Saskatchewan, my passion for technology has been the driving force
            behind my creative endeavors. Inspired by the immersive worlds of 
            science fiction, particularly classics like Dune, I have embarked 
            on numerous projects fuled by imagination and a thirst for 
            learning.</p>

            <p class="flex justify-center md:max-w-2xl md:mx-auto lg:max-w-4xl 
            m-5">I am also deeply immersed in the GNU / Linux ecosystem, 
            finding joy in its versatility and open-source ethos. Recently, 
            I have found myself drawn to the intricate realm of DevOps. 
            Exploring this field has aligned perfectly with my profound 
            interest in automation, while sparking a keen curiosity about 
            deploying infastructure. I am eager to apply my education, 
            personal experiences, and love for GNU / Linux to excel in 
            this dynamic field.</p>
